# html

This is a small and opinated HTML 5 Boilerplate that I've build after redoing these steps a few times. It takes inspiration on the famous [HTML 5 Boilerplate](github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).

## Dependencies

A `package.json` is present to specify some utilities written on Node.JS and shipped using NPM. You can install them using `npm install`.

Some of the tools available are:

* [Stylus](https://github.com/learnboost/stylus);
* [CSSLint](https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint).

## Makefile

This Makefile ships with some goodies.

* `make server` - Starts a simple HTTPServer on 8000 port using Python `SimpleHTTPServer`;
* `make compile` - Compiles the default Stylus stylesheet.
* `make lint` - Runs CSSLint on `./stylesheets`.
